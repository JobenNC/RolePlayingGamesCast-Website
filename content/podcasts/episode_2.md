â€œWhy is everybody singing?"

Join us for a night at the opera! For those of you playing along, we'll be covering the game from the end of episode 1 until after the Maduin flashback.

Joe just finished Final Fantasy XV, and you'll hear our thoughts on that game in this episode. Spoiler material starts at 4:20 (with a warning) and ends at 11:15

We've gotten good feedback regarding the show format, so we're back with our four segments!

* Side Quests
  * Joe and Tony talk FFXV, .hack, and PSVR!
- News
  - Smash Bros Switch, Elder Scrolls, and Resident Evil 2
- The Grind
  - Joe and Tony are reading almost the same book. Tony tells us about the worst guessing game he's ever played.
- The Game
  - We defend Narshe and then put on one hell of an opera. 

Thank you so much for listening!
