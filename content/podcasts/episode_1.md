“Ahem... there’s SAND on my boots!"  

We finally embark on our first bit of Final Fantasy VI, and it's certianly not a slow start!  

<!--more-->

For those of you playing along at home (and we encourage you to do just that), we'll be playing from the beginning of the game up until your three separated parties are reunited in Narshe.  

We're also trying out version 1.0 of our show format. In this episode, you'll find us talking about:


* Side Quests
  * The other games we've been playing this week.
- News
  - We chat about what's new in the world of video games.
- The Grind
  - How are we leveling ourselves up? What the heck else have we been up to?
- The Game
  - We recap and discuss this episode's section of gameplay.  

**NOTE:** We had some technical difficulties during this first episode. We've got some mouse clicking noises that we shouldn't have recorded, and at the end the sync between the two of us gets a bit off. I promise, we aren't just trying to talk over each other!  

We hope you'll all enjoy!
